Hello-I-m-Clinton-Iwuji

I am an Information Security Professional specializing in SOC operations, threat detection, and network security. I focus on log analysis, identifying malicious activity, strengthening defensive controls, and improving the overall security posture of the environments I support. I bring a focus centered approach to cybersecurity, combining strong technical skills with clear communication, analytical thinking, and a commitment to continuous learning.

Prior to transitioning into cybersecurity, I developed a strong foundation in human behavior and risk assessment through my work as an Intake Counselor and Mental Health Worker. This experience strengthened my assessment capabilities, documentation practices, critical thinking, and ability to collaborate effectively with multidisciplinary teams skills that directly enhance my performance in security operations.

My background in psychology provides a unique advantage in understanding behavioral patterns, social engineering tactics, and the human element behind cyber threats. This enables me to more effectively analyze user activity, identify anomalies, and communicate complex technical findings in a clear and supportive manner.

I currently apply this combined expertise across SOC monitoring and incident analysis, network traffic review, SIEM log analysis (including DNS, firewall, endpoint, and authentication events), threat investigation and documentation, vulnerability assessment support, and security automation for continuous process improvement. I hold CompTIA Security+ and CySA+ certifications and am passionate about defending systems, understanding adversary behavior, and contributing to security teams that value both technical precision and human insight.
